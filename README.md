  * Offer flexible working hours, wellness programs, and sufficient leave policies to support a healthy balance.

* **Prioritize female candidates when hiring for HR roles**

  * Data indicates that female employees tend to outperform male counterparts in Human Resources roles.
  * Companies should consider gender diversity as a strategic advantage when recruiting for HR positions.

* **Recognize higher performance in Development and Sales departments**

  * Employees in Development and Sales consistently show higher performance compared to other departments.
  * Continue to invest in these departments through training, tools, and incentive programs to maximize their potential.

* **Focus on employees with low to medium satisfaction but excellent performance**

  * A significant number of employees with low or medium scores in Job Satisfaction and Relationship Satisfaction still deliver excellent performance.
  * These employees should not be overlooked; instead, management should engage with them to understand their needs and provide tailored support to retain and motivate them.
